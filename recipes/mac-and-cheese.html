    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread <br>
        crumb topping is creamy and comforting. It's easy <br>
        to make the cheese sauce from scratch on your <br>
        stovetop, starting with a roux and adding milk, <br>
        Cheddar, and Parmesan, resulting in a rich, <br>
        decadent sauce that coats every nook and cranny <br>
        of the noodles.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Box of uncooked Macaroni Noodles</li>
            <li>Butter & Flour</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Salt, Pepper and Paprika</li>
            <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Boil the noodles: </strong>Boil the macaroni in salted <br>
        water until the noodles are al dente. Drain and transfer to a <br>
        prepared baking dish.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the Cheese sauce: </strong>Melt butter, then whisk <br>
        in the flour. Whisk in the milk, bring to a simmer, and stir in <br>
        the cheeses. Season with salt and pepper and continue simmering <br>
        until the sauce is thick. Pour the sauce over the noodles and stir.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the topping:</strong>Melt two tablespoons of butter <br>
        in a skillet, add the bread crumbs, and toast until the crumbs <br>
        are brown. Spread the topping over the macaroni and cheese, <br>
        then sprinkle with paprika.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake the mac and cheese</strong>Bake in the preheated oven<br>
    until the topping is golden brown</li>
</ol>
